                <p><b>The Beginning: Curiosity & Learning to Code </b><br><br>
                    In June 2024, my curiosity led me to explore Python and Full-Stack Development. With no prior coding experience, I was fascinated by how software is built and wanted to understand the logic behind applications. Every day, I explored new concepts, eager to turn my ideas into real projects.</p>

                <p> <b>Bridging UI/UX to Development </b><br><br>
                    Before diving into development, I worked on UI/UX design, mapping out project flows to create a seamless user experience. However, when it came to turning these designs into a complete project, I felt stuck. I had the vision, but I didn’t know how to plan and execute the development process effectively.</p>

                <p><b>Discovering Product Management </b><br><br>
                    To bridge this gap, I started researching Product Management and found resources like PM courses, YouTube videos, articles, and Pendo.io materials. I learned how to prioritize features, structure execution, and make strategic decisions—skills that transformed how I approached projects. Instead of just designing or coding, I began thinking about how to build and manage products efficiently.</p>

                <p><b>Aspiring Product Manager & Future Goals </b><br><br>
                    By February 2025, we had built two case studies, focusing on solving business and user problems through structured execution and decision-making. This journey wasn’t just about learning development—it was about understanding how to plan, manage, and execute products effectively.
                    
                    We are aspiring Product Managers, passionate about building impactful products.
